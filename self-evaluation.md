How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel pretty confident with arrays and what they are used for, I also feel pretty confident with putting them together. 
Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson? I would like to learn more about boolean arrays from my understanding booleans are just true false returns and I don't understand how that works in an array.
What questions do you have about Arrays?
How a boolean array works - not sure I quite understand.
